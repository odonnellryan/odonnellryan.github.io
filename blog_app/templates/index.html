            Hi! <a href="http://github.com/odonnellryan">I'm Ryan O'Donnell</a> and I'm passionate about Programming, Web Technology, Open Source Software, and Design. I love to read up on new innovations and practices in the Software and Programming cultures. I spend my time working on my own software projects as well as contributing as I can to the Open Source community. I follow certain projects very closely, particuarly <a href="http://docker.io/">Docker</a> and <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started programming by using Flask (python) for some personal projects. Over time I have used my knowledge developed tools for my employers to use to better improve their services and employee workflows. I work for a company that manages the Information and Technology infrastructure for over fifty clients which range in size from a few to several thousand employees.
